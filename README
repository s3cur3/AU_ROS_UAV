  This is a collision avoidance module for the Auburn University UAV ATTRACT
  project. It uses Dynamic Sparse A* Search to plan optimal or nearly-optimal, 
  flyable paths for UAVs.
  
  This code is a collaborative effort between Thomas Crescenzi of Marist College,
  Tyler Young, and Andrew Kaizer, both of Truman State University.

  It was created during an 8-week, NSF-funded Research Experience for 
  Undergraduates (REU) at Auburn University, between May and July of 2011.
  
  As it stands, the project is sadly incomplete. Whereas we confirm that A* can  
  safely and reliably guide up to 15 aircraft in a 500 m by 500 m airspace in
  simulations without turning constraints, enforcing real-world turning 
  capabilities has proven much more time consuming than we anticipated. Given more
  time, we are confident these results could be obtained in real-world simulations.
  As it stands, however, our simulations show 1 to 2 potential collisions for as
  few as 8 aircraft in a 500 m by 500 m airspace, with as many or more for 16
  aircraft in the same space.
